In this code, I created the basic version black jack.

In this game there are a couple rules:
* There can be 1 - 7 players
* There is a deck of 52 cards
* The Dealer will always hit when their cards are under 17
* Ace can be either 1 or 11
* Players can choose to hit or stay
* If a Player gets over 21, they automatically lose
* If a player and dealer tie in score, then the player pushes

The game will continue until the user tells the code it wants to stop the game
